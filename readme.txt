** How to get started

- Add the following line to your manifest to include this package (or load the url from the package manager):
  "com.unidice.simulator": "https://github.com/ExtraNiceBV/Unidice-Simulator.git"
  
- Import the simulator and the template "samples" from the package manager. You can ignore conflicting GUID warnings (it is resolved correctly).

- Drag the Template folder from Samples to your Asset folder in the project view. You can rename and change it later as much as you wish.

- Add the Loader scene from the template as your first build scene, and the simulator scene from the samples folder as the second.

- Add your own (or one of the template scenes) to the build scenes and open it.

- Click "Load simulator" in the hierarchy to load the simulator scene with it.
