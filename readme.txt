Add the following line to your manifest to include this package (or load the url from the package manager):
  "com.unidice.simulator": "https://github.com/ExtraNiceBV/Unidice-Simulator.git"
  
Then import the simulator and the template "samples" from the package manager. You can ignore conflicting GUID warnings (it is resolved correctly).
